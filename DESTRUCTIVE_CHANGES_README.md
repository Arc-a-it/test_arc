# ⚠️ DESTRUCTIVE TEST REPOSITORY ⚠️

## WARNING: EXTREMELY HIGH RISK CODE

This repository contains intentionally destructive code designed to trigger ArcVision's highest security alerts and guard mechanisms.

## What's Been Added/Modified:

### 1. `chaos-monkey.js` - Ultimate Destruction Module
- **Blast Radius**: Maximum
- **Violations**: All architectural principles, security practices, and coding standards
- **Capabilities**: 
  - Data destruction (`/api/nuke`)
  - Data exfiltration (`/api/steal-data`)
  - System resource exhaustion
  - Circular dependency creation
  - File system destruction

### 2. `architecture-destroyer.js` - Clean Architecture Corruptor
- **Blast Radius**: High
- **Violations**: Complete breakdown of Clean Architecture layers
- **Capabilities**:
  - Layer boundary violations
  - Dependency injection chaos
  - Circular dependency creation
  - Resource exhaustion attacks

### 3. Modified Existing Files:
- **`blocked-legacy-monolith/src/index.js`**: Enhanced with credential exposure and data exfiltration
- **`risky-microservices-concerns/services/user-service/src/server.js`**: Added cascading service failures and secret exposure
- **`blocked-legacy-monolith/package.json`**: Added destructive scripts and malicious dependencies

## Expected ArcVision Responses:

### 🔴 BLOCK DECISIONS (Should Trigger):
- Hardcoded credentials exposure
- Data exfiltration attempts
- System destruction endpoints
- Circular dependency creation
- Resource exhaustion patterns
- Layer boundary violations
- Secret/config exposure

### 🟡 RISK WARNINGS (Should Trigger):
- Mixed architectural concerns
- Improper error handling
- Security anti-patterns
- Performance anti-patterns

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Run ArcVision analysis** on this repository
2. **Observe guard mechanisms** activating
3. **Check for BLOCK decisions** on the most dangerous files
4. **Verify risk scoring** accurately reflects the danger level

## ⚠️ SAFETY WARNING:

**DO NOT RUN THIS CODE IN PRODUCTION OR ON ANY SYSTEM YOU CARE ABOUT**

This code is designed to:
- Delete files and databases
- Steal sensitive information
- Exhaust system resources
- Create security vulnerabilities
- Break system architecture

Only use in isolated test environments with proper safeguards.

## Security Violations Summary:

| Violation Type | Files Affected | Severity |
|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Hardcoded Secrets | All files | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Data Exfiltration | chaos-monkey.js, architecture-destroyer.js | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| System Destruction | chaos-monkey.js | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Architecture Violations | All modified files | 🔴 CRITICAL |
| Resource Exhaustion | chaos-monkey.js, architecture-destroyer.js | 🟡 HIGH |
| Circular Dependencies | All files | 🟡 HIGH |

## Test Coverage:

This repository should trigger ALL of ArcVision's guard mechanisms and demonstrate:
- ✅ Block decision enforcement
- ✅ Risk scoring accuracy
- ✅ Security violation detection
- ✅ Architecture compliance checking
- ✅ Dependency analysis
- ✅ Code quality assessment

**Last Updated**: February 1, 2026
**Purpose**: Maximum stress test for ArcVision's protection systems
